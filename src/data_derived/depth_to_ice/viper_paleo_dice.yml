title: "VIPER Paleo Depth to Ice Map" 
description: >-
  The pixel values in this map represent the depth (in meters) at
  which ice could be stable at each location if the lunar pole were at
  a different paleo location.  This map was rasterized
  from a combination of meshes with variable facet sizes, a large
  area with 10 m facets in some areas, and a few specific areas
  with fine triangles 2 m in size.  The geometry of these meshes
  were derived from converting the viper_sfs_dem.tif into a mesh
  of varying sizes, but the depth values for each facet were derived
  from the modeling process. Since this file is rasterized from
  source data with a variety of different mesh sizes, this map has
  a 0.5 m/pixel ground scale distance, which allows discernment of
  the finest 2 m meshes in the source data.  The "nodata" values
  in the map indicate areas where the model did not find an ice
  stability depth as far down as 2.5 m.
modification_details: 
- version: 999.1
  date: "2025-03-05"
  description: >-
    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.
- version: 999.2
  date: "2025-04-21"

     This data product was derived from a shape-from-shading terrain
     model which in turn is derived from LROC images and based on
     LOLA data.
