    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.

    This external product is a web page
    (https://pgda.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/78) that contains improved
    LOLA digital elevation models (DEMs) of several regions surrounding
    high-priority lunar south pole landing sites using exclusively
    laser altimetry data acquired by LRO-LOLA. The data there used
    to build this product is designated as "Site2-v2: Leibnitz beta
    plateau, extended boundaries" on that GSFC site.
