title: "VIPER Shape from Shading (SfS) Count Map" 
description: >-
  Count map.  Pixel value indicates the total number of illuminated
  pixels (pixels from the orthoimages greater than 0.005) for each
  location based on the limited number of images actually used for
  the SfS solution.
modification_details: 
- version: 999.1
  date: 2025-03-05
  description: >-
    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.
- version: 999.2
  date: 2025-04-21
  description: >-
    Moved the viper_ortho_images.csv from being a File_Area_Observational_Supplemental
    to being a Source_Product_Internal.  Also added some product information to the
    GeoTIFF TIFFTAGs.
