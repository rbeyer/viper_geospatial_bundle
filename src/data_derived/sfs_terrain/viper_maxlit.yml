title: "VIPER Shape from Shading (SfS) Maximally-illuminated LROC Mosaic" 
description: >-
  Maximally-illuminated mosaic based on LROC NAC images.  This
  ortho-mosaic is a combination of the co-registered VIPER LROC NAC
  Orthoimages such that for each pixel in the output mosaic, the
  brightest pixel from the input images at that location is used.
  This provides a mosaic that "appears" to have sunlight coming
  from multiple directions, but attempts to show all of the illuminated
  terrain in this area.  This is a 32-bit GeoTIFF.
modification_details: 
- version: 999.1
  date: 2025-03-05
  description: >-
    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.
