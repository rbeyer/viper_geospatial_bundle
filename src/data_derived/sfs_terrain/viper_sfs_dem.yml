title: "VIPER Shape from Shading (SfS) Digital Elevation Model (DEM)" 
description: >
  Shape from Shading Digital Elevation Model as a GeoTIFF with
  32-bit pixels indicating the elevation with respect to the lunar
  radius of 1,737,400 m at 1 m/pixel.  In areas not illuminated in
  any of the source LROC NAC images, one of two things were done.
  If the area was small, the pixels were filled by interpolating
  the SfS data.  If the area was larger, then the area was filled
  with improved LOLA data, and a smooth blend from SfS to LOLA was
  applied.
modification_details: 
- version: 999.1
  date: 2025-03-05
  description: >
    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.
