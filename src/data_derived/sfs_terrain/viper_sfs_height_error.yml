title: "VIPER Shape from Shading (SfS) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Height Error Map" 
description: >-
  A height uncertainty product derived from creating simulated
  images by taking the SfS DEM and illuminating it in a manner
  similar to each source image.  This height-error map has the
  maximum height perturbation at each pixel, in meters, which will
  make at least one of the simulated images at that pixel change
  by more than twice the discrepancy between the unperturbed simulated
  image and the measured image.  This is an ad-hoc relative measure
  which is larger where the SfS DEM is less accurate.  This is a
  32-bit GeoTIFF.  Areas that were not illuminated by any source
  image have their pixels set to the no-data value.
modification_details: 
- version: 999.1
  date: 2025-03-05
  description: >-
    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.
- version: 999.2
  date: 2025-04-21
  description: >-
    Updated VIPER Site Analysis paper to submitted and added product information
    to the GeoTIFF TIFFTAGs.

obs_system_desc: >-
     This data product was derived from the shape-from-shading terrain
     model (derived from LROC and LOLA) and LROC images.

proc_name: Estimate SfS Height Errors
proc_desc: >-
  This is the processing step that takes as input the SfS terrain
  and the LROC images to produce this height estimate.
proc_owner: Oleg Alexandrov and Ross Beyer
proc_inst: NASA Ames Research Center

software_programs:
- name: sfs
  desc: >-
    The ASP program is run again, this time with the
    --estimate-height-errors option to produce the height error
    map.  The parameters listed here are not complete, but are the
    relevant parameters to sfs for this computation.
  params:
  - name: --estimate-height-errors
    type: Input
    value: None, this option is a flag only.
  - name: --input-dem
