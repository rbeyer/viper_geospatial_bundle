title: "VIPER Shape from Shading (SfS) Maximally Illuminated Mask map" 
description: >-
  Mask derived from the max-lit mosaic.  The non-zero pixels in
  this 8-bit image are the pixels at which the max-lit mosaic
  pixel values are greater than 0.005.  This map gives an indication
  of which pixels in the sfs terrain were supported by images.
  However, it does not provide an exact match to "detailed" areas
  in the sfs terrain, as you might expect.  The sfs
  terrain is not an independent solution, it uses images to "improve"
  on an existing terrain model.  So in areas where there are only
  a few images (typically near shadow boundaries) the sfs algorithm
  is working (thus gets a non-zero value in this map), but is not
  "improving" the terrain a great deal over the input terrain (which
  is LOLA), so those areas may still look "smooth."
modification_details: 
- version: 999.1
  date: 2025-03-05
  description: >-
    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.
- version: 999.2
  date: 2025-04-21
  description: >-
    Added product information to the GeoTIFF TIFFTAGs.

obs_system_desc: >-
     This data product was derived from a shape-from-shading terrain
     model which in turn is derived from LROC images and based on
     LOLA data.
