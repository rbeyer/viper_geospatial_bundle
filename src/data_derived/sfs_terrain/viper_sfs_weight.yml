title: "VIPER Shape from Shading (SfS) LOLA Weight" 
description: >-
  The weight showing the proportion of the SfS DEM in the blend
  with the LOLA DEM (1 is for purely SfS and 0 is for purely LOLA).
  This is a 32-bit GeoTIFF.  Note that the gaps or holes which were
  filled by interpolated SfS data register as DN value 1 (even
  though they were not illuminated), and only those gaps large
  enough to need LOLA data have values less than 1.
modification_details: 
- version: 999.1
  date: 2025-03-05
  description: >-
    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.

  This is the processing step that takes as input the SfS terrain
  and the LOLA Terrain and produces this map.

    This is actually produced via the same run of sfs_blend that
    produces viper_sfs_dem.tif, but we are indicating the relevant
    parameters.
