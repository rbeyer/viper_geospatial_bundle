title: VIPER Max Temperature 
description: >-
  The pixel values in this map represent the maximum temperature
  (in Kelvin) that each location experiences during a period of a
  year prior to VIPER landing. This map was rasterized from a
  combination of meshes with variable facet sizes, a large area
  with 10 m facets in some areas, and a few specific areas with
  fine triangles 2 m in size.  The geometry of these meshes were
  derived from converting the viper_sfs_dem.tif into a mesh of
  varying sizes, but the temperature values for each facet were
  derived from the modeling process. Since this file is rasterized
  from source data with a variety of different mesh sizes, this map
  has a 0.5 m/pixel ground scale distance, which allows discernment
  of the finest 2 m meshes in the source data.
modification_details: 
- version: 999.1
  date: "2025-03-05"
  description: >-
    Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
    instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
    the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
    before PDS release 1.0.
- version: 999.2
  date: 2025-04-21
  description: >-
    Updated VIPER Site Analysis paper to submitted and added product information
    to the GeoTIFF TIFFTAGs.

obs_system_desc: >-
     This data product was derived from a shape-from-shading terrain
     model which in turn is derived from LROC images and based on
     LOLA data.
