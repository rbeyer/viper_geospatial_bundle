modification_details:
  - version: 999.1
    date: 2025-03-13
    description: >-
      Dumb information model forces this to be a 'valid' version
      instead of 0.1 for testing, which should be allowed.  This is
      the first draft.  All version 999 modifications will be removed
      before PDS release 1.0.
  - version: 999.2
    date: 2025-04-21
    description: >-
      Added Bundle DOI as the DOI for the Citation of *this* Collection which seems odd,
      but better than minting DOIs for each Collection or leaving it off, I guess?
